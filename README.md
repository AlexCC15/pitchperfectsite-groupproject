Challenges:

During development, our biggest challenge was understanding the branch function. We experienced a lot of trial and error to understand how it worked and getting to the finished product. We experienced some issues with flexbox and getting the layout consistent throughout. The media query portion also proved a challenge with the header alignment varying at times per branch. 

We also experienced a conflict with the .gitignore and the .DS Store files in the aca-shop branch which forced us to create a new branch with the same details. Hence the reason why there is only one commit to this new branch. The previous aca_shop branch is still within the repository showing the original commit history.
